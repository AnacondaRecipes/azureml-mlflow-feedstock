  summary: Azure Machine Learning SDK allows to build and run machine learning workflows with Azure Machine Learning
           services.
  description: |
    Key areas of the SDK include:
    * Explore, prepare and manage the lifecycle of your datasets used in machine learning experiments.
    * Manage cloud resources for monitoring, logging, and organizing your machine learning experiments.
    * Train models either locally or by using cloud resources, including GPU-accelerated model training.
    * Use automated machine learning, which accepts configuration parameters and training data. It automatically
      iterates through algorithms and hyperparameter settings to find the best model for running predictions.
    * Deploy web services to convert your trained models into RESTful services that can be consumed in any application.
